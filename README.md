Hello!
  This is my GitHub where I house various projects I've worked on or will be working on!
  I'm a beginning coder and a first-year computer science student so I’m new to using
  GitHub. I hope to get better over time as I add more projects! I don't have a particular
  interest in game development, but I'm trying to delve into the different computer
  science areas to discover other interests! I’m looking forward to collaborating on a 
  future project but I am not entirely sure what I want to do yet. I'll keep this bio
  updated about that!
